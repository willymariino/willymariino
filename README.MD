## About Me
Hi, I'm Willy â€” a Junior Full Stack Developer with a strong interest in building real-world applications. 
I mainly work with React, Node.js, MySQL, and JavaScript, focusing on creating responsive, maintainable, and user-friendly projects.
I enjoy tackling both front-end UI challenges and back-end API logic, always striving to write clean and well-structured code. 
This repository is part of my continuous effort to grow by building practical applications and learning best practices along the way.
